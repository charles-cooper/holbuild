# Root HOL source package sketch

HOL itself is implicit in project mode. The selected checkout is chosen by
`--holdir`, `HOLBUILD_HOLDIR`, or `HOLDIR`; users do not declare
`[dependencies.HOLDIR]` or `[dependencies.HOL]`.

The intended implicit package is deliberately simple:

```toml
[project]
name = "HOL"

[build]
members = ["src", "examples/algorithms", "examples/category", "..."]
# no roots
# default excludes: stdknl/no-tracing/poly selection,
# selftests/tests, and known duplicate variants
```

`holproject.toml` in this directory is an older audit artifact showing one way to
index a subset of root HOL. It is useful historical data, but it is not the final
user-facing model. The final model makes normal `$HOLDIR/src` and a curated set
of mature `$HOLDIR/examples` subtrees visible for dependency resolution while
selecting the stdknl/no-tracing/PolyML source view and excluding selftests/tests
and duplicate variants that are not intended as part of the
default package namespace.

Semantic bootstrap starts from `bin/hol.state0` via `hol --bare`. Bare-provided
modules/theories are treated as already available. Non-bare scripts receive the
standard HOL environment from a holbuild-managed checkpoint constructed from
source-built `bossLib` and `holTheory`, then `open bossLib`.

Probe shape:

```sh
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
cat > "$tmp/holproject.toml" <<EOF
[project]
name = "probe"

[build]
members = []
EOF

(cd "$tmp" && /path/to/holbuild --holdir "$HOLDIR" build --dry-run)
```
