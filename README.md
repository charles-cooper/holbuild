# A modern, human- and agent-friendly build system for HOL4

`holbuild` is an experimental project-aware build frontend for HOL4.

This repository is an external prototype for the design in HOL issue #1916:
`holproject.toml` as a project manifest, logical build targets, project-level
artifacts, and a future in-tree `hol build` implementation.

## Current scope

This prototype is intentionally small:

- reads and schema-checks the nearest `holproject.toml`
- establishes a shared project context for `build`, `run`, and `repl`
- reuses HOL's existing SML TOML parser from `$HOLDIR/tools/Holmake/toml`
- accepts logical build targets such as `MyTheory`, not object filenames such as `MyTheory.uo`
- owns source discovery and maps outputs to project-level `.holbuild/`
- infers theory/module dependencies with HOL/Holdep machinery over the resolved project graph and orders build plans
- parses transitive dependency manifests and local `.holconfig.toml` path overrides
- materializes dependency plans under project `.holbuild/deps/<package>/`
- rejects duplicate logical theory/module names across the resolved graph, except
  local `.sig`/`.sml` companion pairs
- includes project `load "Module"` SML/SIG dependencies in build plans and internal load manifests
- records generated theory ML dependencies from HOL theory metadata in internal load manifests
- rejects source-level `use "file"` in project build actions; declare/load project modules instead
- supports per-action policy for explicit logical dependencies/loadable modules, extra inputs, cache disabling, and always-rerun actions
- computes prototype source/resolved-dependency input keys for planned actions
- schedules build actions in DAG-ready parallel order with `-jN`, local `[build].jobs`, or a CPU-derived default
- executes simple theory-script builds into project `.holbuild/` without Holmake
- records local action metadata and skips unchanged actions
- publishes/restores simple theory semantic artifacts through the global cache
- includes the configured toolchain/base context in prototype action keys
- creates transient local theory checkpoints while building: dependencies-loaded and final-context checkpoints when checkpointing is enabled, plus theorem end-of-proof/context and failed-prefix proof-navigation checkpoints when goalfrag theorem instrumentation is enabled; successful builds remove them after writing logical artifacts and metadata
- runs modern theorem proofs through a shared SML goalfrag runtime helper, with tactic parsing/step planning, proof-manager execution, checkpoint saves, timeout handling, and diagnostics kept out of generated per-theory source
- keeps goalfrag proof execution separate from checkpoint creation; `--skip-checkpoints` avoids theory `.save` files entirely, `--skip-goalfrag` opts out of theorem instrumentation but can still use non-theorem dependency/final-context checkpoints, and `--tactic-timeout SECONDS` controls the root-project per-tactic goalfrag timeout (default 2.5s; `0` disables it)
- exports explicit project heap targets from `[[heap]]` entries using local SaveState
- exposes `holbuild gc` for project-local residue cleanup plus global-cache GC with a 7-day default retention policy
- does not delegate build semantics to Holmake
- treats `.uo`/`.ui` as internal ML artifacts, never user-requestable targets
- delegates execution to `$HOLDIR/bin/hol run` / `hol repl` for now

The external prototype requires a HOL checkout or installation via `HOLDIR` so it
can reuse HOL tooling. Current code still starts actions from `$HOLDIR/bin/hol.state`
and includes that heap in the toolchain key; it does not create a project-local
copy under `.holbuild/checkpoints/_base`. The target design replaces this
configured seed with bootstrap/checkpoint state that `hol build` can rebuild or
restore hermetically under `.holbuild/` after `git pull`. See `DESIGN.md`.

## Current validation status

This is still an alpha prototype, but it is now production-dogfooded beyond toy
cases. The full holbuild test suite passes against the local HOL checkout. The
Vyper HOL project worktree has passed rooted project builds with goalfrag and
transient checkpoints enabled using `--no-cache --tactic-timeout 0`; focused
finite-timeout smoke testing for the large `instIdxIndepTheory` target passes at
`--tactic-timeout 60`. The default root timeout remains intentionally strict
(2.5s) for proof-debug feedback and is not expected to be a universal production
setting for all root projects.

## Build

```sh
make HOLDIR=/path/to/HOL
make HOLDIR=/path/to/HOL test
HOLBUILD_TEST_JOBS=16 make HOLDIR=/path/to/HOL test
```

Optional install:

```sh
make HOLDIR=/path/to/HOL install
```

This installs only the `holbuild` executable to `$HOME/.local/bin/holbuild` by
default. Override with `PREFIX`, `BINDIR`, or `DESTDIR` if needed. Runtime HOL
selection still uses `--holdir PATH`, `HOLBUILD_HOLDIR`, or `HOLDIR`.

The compiler loads HOL's existing SML TOML parser from `$(HOLDIR)` and embeds it
in `bin/holbuild`. Tests live under `tests/cases/*/test.sh` so they can move into
HOL's selftest layout with minimal reshaping; `tests/run.sh` is the repo-local
runner and can run cases in parallel with `HOLBUILD_TEST_JOBS`. Current cases
cover simple theory builds, package overrides, local build excludes, build roots,
cross-package SML load resolution, dependency cycle rejection, conservative
invalidation, checkpoint replay/recovery, process cleanup on interrupt,
logical-name conflict rejection, cache restoration/corruption/concurrency/GC,
parallel diamonds, same-project write locking, explicit heaps, object-target
rejection, manifest schema validation, status output, root/dependency tactic
timeout policy, and generated theory dependency/path stability.

## Usage

```sh
export HOLBUILD_HOLDIR=/path/to/HOL
bin/holbuild build MyTheory
bin/holbuild -j4 build MyTheory
bin/holbuild --maxheap 4096 build MyTheory
bin/holbuild --source-dir /path/to/project build MyTheory
bin/holbuild build --skip-checkpoints MyTheory
bin/holbuild build --tactic-timeout 5 MyTheory
bin/holbuild goalfrag-plan MyTheory:my_theorem
bin/holbuild build --force --goalfrag-trace MyTheory
bin/holbuild --json build MyTheory
```

Useful inspection/maintenance commands:

```sh
bin/holbuild context
bin/holbuild build --dry-run MyTheory
bin/holbuild gc
```

Additional prototype commands exist for project-context execution and explicit
heap exports:

```sh
bin/holbuild run someScript.sml
bin/holbuild repl
bin/holbuild heap main
```

`--holdir PATH` can be used instead of `HOLBUILD_HOLDIR` at runtime for HOL
commands. `--source-dir PATH` or `HOLBUILD_SOURCE_DIR` selects the project source
root for manifest discovery and `.holbuild` artifacts without changing the shell's
current directory. `-jN`, `-j N`, or `--jobs N` controls build parallelism for `build`
and for the build phase of `heap` targets; the default comes from local
`.holconfig.toml` `[build].jobs` when set, otherwise from CPU detection as
`max(1, nproc / 2)`. `--force` ignores local up-to-date state and global cache
restore so the requested plan executes from source; cache publication still
happens unless `--no-cache` is also set. `--no-cache` disables global cache
restore/publish while preserving local `.holbuild` up-to-date checks. `--maxheap MB` and
`--max-heap MB` pass Poly/ML's maximum heap size to child HOL processes before
`run`/`repl`, matching HOL's requirement that runtime options precede the
subcommand.
`--skip-checkpoints` disables theory checkpoint `.save`/`.ok` creation without
disabling goalfrag proof execution. By default checkpoints may be created during
a build but are removed after successful artifact/metadata writes.
`--skip-goalfrag` opts out of modern theorem instrumentation.
`--tactic-timeout SECONDS` sets the root-project per-tactic goalfrag timeout;
the default is 2.5 seconds, and `0` disables the timeout. Dependency packages
build with no tactic timeout. `goalfrag-plan THEORY:THEOREM` statically prints a
faithful, pretty form of the executable GoalFrag step IR for one theorem and exits
without building. Each numbered line is one executable tactic/list-tactic/GoalFrag
operation; indentation and body text are formatting only. `--goalfrag-trace`
runs a build, records runtime traces for all instrumented proofs in the child log,
and prints the failed theorem's trace excerpt on failure. Use trace with `--force`
when you need to force source execution for proof-performance/debug inspection.
Combining `--skip-goalfrag` with
`--tactic-timeout`, `--goalfrag-plan`, or `--goalfrag-trace` is an error because
all three are implemented by the goalfrag runtime. Goalfrag/checkpoint/timeout
policy affects execution and diagnostics, not final theory artifact action keys. `--json` emits newline-delimited
JSON status/message/error events for build output. `gc` removes stale project-local
`.holbuild` stage/log/checkpoint residue and runs global cache GC using `$HOLBUILD_CACHE`,
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/holbuild`, or `$HOME/.cache/holbuild`; `gc --clean-only` skips the
cache and `gc --cache-only` skips project discovery/locking and does not require a HOL
toolchain.

See `DESIGN.md` for the intended long-term model: manifest-based package
resolution, project-local `.holbuild/` materialization, action-key invalidation,
root-HOL migration through an explicit/default HOL manifest, and an optional
global cache that can share validated dependency state without changing build
semantics. A root-HOL manifest sketch lives under `examples/root-hol/`.

## Example `holproject.toml`

```toml
[holbuild]
schema = 1

[project]
name = "example"
version = "0.1.0"

[build]
members = ["src", "examples"]
roots = ["src/MainScript.sml"]
exclude = ["*/selftest.sml", "*/examples/*"]

[dependencies.foo]
git = "https://github.com/acme/foo"
rev = "abc123"

[actions.MyTheory]
deps = ["MyProjectLib"]
loads = ["SomeExternalLib"]
extra_inputs = ["data/table.txt"]
cache = false

[run]
heap = "build/main.heap"
loads = ["MyProjectLib"]

[[heap]]
name = "main"
output = "build/main.heap"
objects = ["MyProjectLib"]
```

## Local dependency overrides

Use an uncommitted `.holconfig.toml` when a declared dependency lives at a
different local path on your machine or when a workstation needs local build
settings:

```toml
[overrides.foo]
path = "../foo-dev"

[build]
jobs = 16
exclude = ["worktrees/*"]
```

The override changes only where the package is found locally. The package still
needs its own `holproject.toml` or an explicit shim manifest from the consumer,
except for the reserved `[dependencies.HOLDIR]` package, which uses holbuild's
built-in root-HOL manifest and the runtime `--holdir`/`HOLBUILD_HOLDIR` path.
There is no `.holpath`, ambient `HOLPATH`, or user-facing include-path schema in
project mode; dependency locations are resolved through manifests plus local
overrides. Local config paths are literal today; shell-style `$HOME` expansion is
a future wishlist item, not current behavior. `[build].roots` lists
package-root-relative source paths for default entry points when `holbuild build`
has no CLI target; root source paths must be
discoverable through `[build].members`. `[build].members` remains the source
discovery scope. When roots are configured, no-target `build` warns about
discoverable theory scripts outside the roots' dependency closure.
`[build].exclude` may explicitly remove package-root-relative globbed
paths from source discovery; it is for keeping tests/tool variants out of a build
package, not for changing load resolution. Generated `*Theory.sml` and
`*Theory.sig` files are ignored automatically. Both `holproject.toml` and
`.holconfig.toml` reject unknown fields in recognized tables so typos fail early.

## Notes

The user-facing model should not expose `.uo`, `.ui`, `.dat`, or other HOL
object filenames as targets. `holbuild build MyTheory` is the intended shape.

`holbuild` should produce the same logical artifacts as Holmake (`.uo`, `.ui`,
`.dat`, generated theory files, etc.) while allowing their physical storage to
move under a project-level `.holbuild/` directory. The top-level directory is not
`.hol/` because Holmake/HOL tooling already uses `.hol` conventions. Any
`.hol/objs` directories written by holbuild are nested compatibility remap copies
inside `.holbuild/`, not the project state root. `.uo` and `.ui` files are internal
ML artifacts; users should request logical targets only. The prototype rejects
ambiguous graphs where two sources export the same logical theory/module name;
the intended exception is a same-package `.sig`/`.sml` companion pair. The
prototype also writes auxiliary `HOLFileSys` remap copies under `.hol/objs` for
path-sensitive internal loads while preserving canonical artifacts in the project
layout.

Theory scripts are modeled as pure build actions by default: no user-specified
side effects are part of the default v1 contract. If a real action has declared
non-source inputs or must not be cached/skipped, make that explicit:

```toml
[actions.MyTheory]
deps = ["MyProjectLib"]
loads = ["SomeExternalLib"]
extra_inputs = ["data/table.txt"]
cache = false
always_reexecute = true
# impure = true is shorthand for no cache and always re-execute
```

`holbuild` uses HOL's `Holdep` machinery to infer normal source dependencies
from old-style `load`/`open` usage and HOLSource headers. `deps` names additional
logical project dependencies when source-level imports are insufficient or
intentionally absent; every listed name must resolve in the manifest/source
graph. `loads` names additional loadable module/library stems for source-implicit
predecessors; matching project modules are resolved in the DAG, otherwise the
name is loaded from the configured HOL toolchain context. `extra_inputs` are
hashed exactly and included in the action key. `cache = false`
disables global-cache restore/publish for that action. `always_reexecute = true`
prevents local up-to-date skipping and any retained/debug checkpoint replay for that action. These
are escape hatches, not ambient include/search paths.

Incremental correctness is action-key based. `holbuild` does not use
`hol buildheap` as its default build primitive; it builds contexts directly by
loading resolved ancestors and, unless `--skip-checkpoints` is set, saving
transient PolyML checkpoints at syntactic boundaries: dependencies loaded,
AST-derived theorem end-of-proof/context boundaries and failed-prefix
proof-navigation state for modern `Theorem ... Proof ... QED` declarations when
goalfrag instrumentation is enabled, and a final post-export context. Successful
builds remove those checkpoint files after writing artifacts and metadata;
failed/interrupted builds may leave them as debug breadcrumbs. `--skip-goalfrag`
removes the theorem proof-navigation checkpoints and tactic timeout path, not the
non-theorem dependency/final-context checkpoint machinery. If a modern theorem
fails after some goalfrag steps, the retained failed-prefix checkpoint can be
reused on the next rebuild by comparing raw proof-body bytes, backing up to the
longest matching current fragment boundary, and replaying the edited suffix.
Simple
theorem-producing forms such as `Theorem name = thm` still build normally but are
not theorem checkpoint boundaries in v1. Explicit `holbuild heap NAME` targets
build their declared logical objects, load the generated theory modules, and save
the requested heap with PolyML SaveState.

The optional global cache stores simple theory semantic artifacts by action key:
`Theory.sig`, a path-rebased `Theory.sml` template, and `Theory.dat`. On a cache
hit, holbuild materializes artifacts into local `.holbuild/`, writes local load
manifests, and validates hashes before dependents use them. It does not restore
successful-build checkpoint files by default. Successful cache hits refresh the
action manifest mtime for retention, rather than relying on filesystem atime.
`holbuild gc` removes stale project-local build residue and stale global-cache
temporary entries, action manifests, and old unreferenced blobs after 7 days by default.

`holbuild run` and `holbuild repl` generate `.holbuild/holbuild-run-context.sml`
in the project root before loading `[run].loads` and user-supplied arguments.

`hol debug` is deliberately out of scope for this prototype.
